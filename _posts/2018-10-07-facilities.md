	A mission control center is being constructed in AERB 120 that will support all on-orbit communication with the satellite. Antennae mounted on the roof of the building will be used to send telecommands to the satellite, while receiving critical telemetry to assess the health of the spacecraft and verify mission objectives are being met.
