			<h2> <strong>RainierSat</strong> </h2> 
			<h3>A demonstration of CubeSat electric propulsion.</h3>
				<br />
					<p> Named after the focal point of the Seattle landscape, our first mission will develop core technologies to be used in future missions. Electric propulsion is a strength of the UWs Aeronautics and Astronautics department, and comprises the primary payload of this satellite. Moreover, this mission will kick-off our integration with senior capstone design and curriculum integration

			<h2><strong> AdamsSat </strong></h2>
			<h3> A demonstration of constrained attitude control </h3>
			<br />
			<p> Named after the second tallest mountain in our state, our second mission will develop an advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) subsystem capable of reorienting the spacecraft while satisfying key constraints. This represents another strenght of UWs Aeronautics and Astronautics department, and can provide earth-imaging capability. </p>
